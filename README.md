# Bubble Pop!

Start by running either `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` for Python 2 or `python -m http.server` for Python 3. This will allow Live.js to auto reload on save.

## Building the mobile app

Create a free account on [Cocoon](https://cocoon.io) and create a new project. Upload a .zip of your HTML, CSS, and JS files. The key settings are *Webview engine: Webview+* and *Fullscreen: No*. All of the other default settings should be fine. Next, add an image like [bubblepop.png](bubblepop.png) as your app's icon. Finally, click the hammer icon to compile your app, once it's done you'll be able to click the green Android emblem, below the name of your project, to download your APK. Load the APK into an emulator (via drag and drop) or load it onto an Android phone to enjoy a simple but fun bubble popping game!
